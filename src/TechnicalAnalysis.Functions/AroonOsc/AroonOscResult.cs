/// Represents the result of the Aroon Oscillator calculation.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The Aroon Oscillator is derived from the Aroon indicator and is calculated as the 
/// difference between Aroon Up and Aroon Down (Aroon Up - Aroon Down). It oscillates 
/// between -100 and +100, with zero as the centerline. Positive values indicate an 
/// upward trend (Aroon Up is greater than Aroon Down), while negative values indicate 
/// a downward trend. The farther the oscillator is from the zero line, the stronger 
/// the trend. Crossovers through zero can signal trend changes, making this a valuable 
/// tool for trend identification and timing entry/exit points.
