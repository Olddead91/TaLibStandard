/// The Average Price is a simple price transformation that calculates the arithmetic mean 
/// of the high, low, close, and open prices for each period. This provides a single value 
/// that represents the average trading price for the period, smoothing out price fluctuations 
/// and potentially providing a clearer view of the overall price trend. It is calculated as: 
/// (High + Low + Close + Open) / 4.
