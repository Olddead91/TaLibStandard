/// <remarks>
/// Beta is a statistical measure that compares the volatility of a security or portfolio 
/// to the volatility of a benchmark (typically a market index). It measures the systematic 
/// risk of an investment. A beta of 1.0 indicates the security moves in line with the market, 
/// greater than 1.0 indicates higher volatility than the market, and less than 1.0 indicates 
/// lower volatility. Negative beta indicates inverse correlation with the market. Beta is 
/// fundamental in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for calculating expected returns.
