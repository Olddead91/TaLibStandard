/// <remarks>
/// The Correlation Coefficient measures the linear relationship between two data series, 
/// typically two securities or a security and a benchmark. Values range from -1 to +1, 
/// where +1 indicates perfect positive correlation (both move in the same direction), 
/// -1 indicates perfect negative correlation (move in opposite directions), and 0 indicates 
/// no linear relationship. This statistical measure is crucial for portfolio diversification, 
/// pairs trading strategies, and understanding market relationships.
