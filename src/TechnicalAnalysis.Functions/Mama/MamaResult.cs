/// MAMA is an adaptive moving average developed by John Ehlers that automatically adjusts
/// to price movement based on the rate of change of phase. It consists of two lines:
/// MAMA (the adaptive moving average) and FAMA (Following Adaptive Moving Average),
/// which work together to identify trends with minimal lag.
