/// The Median Price is a simple price transformation that calculates the midpoint between 
/// the high and low prices for each period. Also known as the High-Low Average, it represents 
/// the middle of the day's trading range and is often used as a simplified representation 
/// of price action. It is calculated as: (High + Low) / 2. This indicator is useful for 
/// identifying the central tendency of price movement within each period.
