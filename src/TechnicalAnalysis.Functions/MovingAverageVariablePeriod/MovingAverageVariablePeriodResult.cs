/// Represents the result of calculating a Moving Average with Variable Period (MAVP) indicator.

/// <remarks>
/// The Moving Average Variable Period indicator is an adaptive moving average that dynamically
/// adjusts its lookback period based on an external input array. This allows the moving average
/// to become more or less responsive to price changes based on market conditions or other indicators,
/// providing a more flexible smoothing mechanism than fixed-period moving averages.
