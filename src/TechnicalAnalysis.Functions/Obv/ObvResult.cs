/// Represents the result of the On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator calculation.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// OBV is a momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. 
/// It maintains a running total of volume, adding volume on up days and subtracting 
/// volume on down days. The theory is that volume precedes price movement, so if a 
/// security is seeing increasing OBV, it is a signal that volume is supporting the 
/// price movement. Divergences between OBV and price can signal potential reversals.
