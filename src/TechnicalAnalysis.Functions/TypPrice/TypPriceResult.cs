/// <remarks>
/// The Typical Price is a price transformation that represents the average price of a 
/// trading period, calculated as the arithmetic mean of the high, low, and close prices. 
/// It is widely used as a more representative single price point than just the closing 
/// price, as it incorporates the entire trading range. The formula is: (High + Low + Close) / 3. 
/// This price is often used as the basis for other indicators like Money Flow Index and 
/// Commodity Channel Index.
